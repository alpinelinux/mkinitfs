.TP
\fB\-b \fIOUTFILE\fR
When boot media are found, a list of them is stored in \fIOUTFILE\fR.
Boot media are identified by the existence of an .boot_repository file.
.TP
\fB\-c \fICRYPTDEVICE\fR
Specifies an block device for decryption.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR
Show usage information.
.TP
\fB\-H \fIHEADERDEVICE\fR

that block device must be specified using this option.
.TP
\fB\-k \fIKEYFILE\fR
Attempt to decrypt the block device given with \fB\-c\fR using a keyfile.
.TP
\fB\-m \fINAME\fR
When the decryption of the block device is successful, it will appear as
/dev/mapper/\fINAME\fR.
.TP
\fB\-n\fI
Do not return non-zero if \fISEARCHDEVICE\fR is not found.

.TP
\fB\-d\fR
Enable debugging output.
.TP
\fB\-f \fISUBSYSTEM\fR
Ignore devices belonging to the given subsystem.
.TP
\fB\-o \fIOFFSET\fR
When mounting an encrypted device, this specifies the payload offset for
cryptsetup.
.TP
\fB\-p \fIPROGRAM\fR
Call this program for uevents which have DEVNAME set.
